# Online_Exam

The goal of this project was to create an online examination portal where people can come and give mock test for different examinations. Exams like GRE, IELTS, GMAT etc.

The front-end was designed in core HTML, CSS. The user interface was made responsive using Bootstrap. Adding JavaScript for validations, Ajax for forms and transporting data and Jquery for better interface and sliders added features to the Web Application. The backend was done in MySQL using PHP as programming language.

The project contains a database naming onlineexam(1).sql which you have to MySQL with name onlineexam. The database has all the tables used in the project. Then make the suitable changes in the connection of database.

This code can help you with working of HTML, CSS, PHP and MySql.

Feel free to contact me if you find any error or a scope for improvement.

Happy Coding
