						<h3>How do I study online?</h3>
<h4>Studying online isn't dissimilar from studying on campus. Online students interact with learning content, teachers and class members in a similar way to campus students. They view lectures, take part in discussions, have one-on-one tutorials with their teachers, work in groups, submit assignments and take exams. The difference is that all this takes place online and the students have control over when all these activities happen.

						<h3>Is online learning a popular option?</h3>
<p>In the US, online examination is quickly becoming mainstream. Europe has been slower to catch on, but we're seeing more of the established European universities respond to the increasing demand for an online method of studying their programmes.
The quality of the education you receive is paramount.  In this only list accredited courses. Since we have seen an incredible growth in the demand for online education as well as the number of options available. We expect the demand for a convenient way to learn to continue, and with it online examination will continue to make itself available as a valuable resource for connecting students to an online classroom.
