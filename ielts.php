<center><h3 style="color:#906";>The International English Language Testing System (Ielts)</center></h3><br />
<p><font size="+1">The IELTS test is developed by some of the world’s leading experts in language assessment. It has an excellent international reputation, and is accepted by over 9,000 organisations worldwide, including schools, universities, employers, immigration authorities and professional bodies.
IELTS is the most widely accepted English language test that uses a one-on-one speaking test to assess your English communication skills. This means that you are assessed by having a real-life conversation with a real person. This is the most effective and natural way of testing your English conversation skills.
You can take IELTS Academic or IELTS General Training – depending on the organisation you are applying to and your plans for the future.
Whatever your reason for taking IELTS, make the most of your language skills.</font>

<h3 style="color:#906;"> Ielts Academic and Ielts General Training</h3><br />
<p ><font size="+1">IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training are designed to cover the full range of ability from non-user to expert user. The Academic version is for test takers who want to study at tertiary level in an English-speaking country or seek professional registration. The General Training version is for test takers who want to work, train, study at a secondary school or migrate to an English-speaking country. 
The difference between the Academic and General Training versions is the content, context and purpose of the tasks. </font></p>

<h3 style="color:#906;">Reading Test Format</h3><br />
<p ><font size="+1">The IELTS Academic Reading Test has 3 sections. You have 60 minutes to complete the test. There is NO extra time at the end of the test to transfer your answers to the answer paper (you get 10 extra minutes in the listening test only); your answers must be on the answer paper at the end of the 60 minutes. The test has 40 questions based on a series of 3 texts. The total length of all the texts put together will be between 2000 and 2750 words. As in all the different parts of IELTS, the Academic Reading Test gets progressively harder through the paper.</font></p>

<h3 style="color:#906;">Listening Test Format</h3></br>
<p ><font size="+1">The IELTS Academic listening test is one area where teachers cannot help students as much as they can in other areas. The skill of listening is one that is developed by practice and there is not much a teacher can say to improve a student’s ability at it. What we can do is to give you some hints for doing the test and also show you the type of question that you will come up against when you do the test. After that, as much practice as possible is the way to improve. This practice can be doing actual IELTS practice tests or by doing any form of listening in English.</font></p>

<h3 style="color:#906;">Speaking Test Format</h3></br>
<p ><font size="+1">The IELTS Academic Speaking test is the shortest of the components of the IELTS test – only 11 to 14 minutes. In this short time you have to convince the examiner who will be speaking with you of your level of English. Practice with good quality IELTS practice tests is very important.The IELTS Academic Speaking Test is the same for both the Academic and General Training modules. The test is conducted with 1 examiner and 1 candidate. The Speaking test is recorded. </font></p>

<h3 style="color:#906;">WRITING TEST – TASK 1</h3><br />
<p ><font size="+1">The IELTS Academic Task 1 Writing is not an easy part of the exam. Describing a graph well in 20 minutes is not something most people can do straight away whether they are English speakers or not. The fact that it is in a foreign language for you as well doesn’t help. Practice is the magic word though. Even good English users need practice with IELTS practice tests and it could mean all the difference between pass and fail. There is limited practice available and it’s quite expensive. That’s why we would recommend you download our IELTS practice tests. </font></p><br />
<h3 style="color:#906;"> WRITING TEST – TASK 2</h3><br />
<p ><font size="+1">Task 2 in the IELTS Academic Writing Test is more important than task 1. You have to write more, it’s a more difficult task and it is worth more to your final band for writing as more weight is given to Task 2 than to Task 1. Practice on IELTS practice tests is important for both tasks. The IELTS Academic Writing Test lasts for 1 hour and includes 2 tasks. Task 1 is a letter and you must write at least 150 words. You should spend about 20 minutes out of the hour for Task 1. Task 2 is an essay and you must write at least 250 words. You should spend about 40 minutes for Task 2.</font></p>
